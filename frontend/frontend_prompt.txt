You are reviewing the current completed state of the GlobeTrotter travel app hackathon project.

Tech Stack (Confirmed & Implemented):

Frontend: React (JSX only, no TypeScript)

Backend: Node.js + Express

External APIs: Geoapify (accessed ONLY via backend proxy)

Security: Geoapify API key stored in .env, never exposed to frontend

Frontend communicates only with backend proxy (fetch)

Frontend – Completed:

Dashboard UI layout is fully implemented with:

Navbar

Banner section

Search & controls section

Top Regional Selections section

Previous Trips section

Footer with “+ Plan a trip” button

Existing CSS and layout preserved (UI structure not altered)

Centralized API helper (geoApi.js) is created and used for all network calls:

/geocode (forward geocoding)

/reverse (reverse geocoding support)

/places (nearby places / POIs)

/place-details (place metadata)

/top-regions (regional discovery)

/route (route preview)

Uses fetch() only

Handles network errors centrally

Dashboard → API integration is completed without changing JSX structure:

Search bar triggers forward geocoding

Selecting a location:

Stores latitude/longitude

Triggers nearby places search

Triggers top-regions discovery by country

Top Regional Selections section:

Populated using /top-regions

Clicking a region triggers nearby places search using sample coordinates

Previous Trips section:

Dynamically populated using /places (nearby POIs)

Clicking a card selects a place

“+ Plan a trip” button:

Triggers /route API call using selected location and place

Route data successfully returned and stored

Backend – Completed:

Express backend with proxy pattern is implemented:

All Geoapify calls are routed via /api/external/*

Frontend never calls Geoapify directly

Backend endpoints implemented and functional:

GET /api/external/geocode

GET /api/external/reverse

GET /api/external/places

GET /api/external/place-details

GET /api/external/top-regions

GET /api/external/route

Security & stability measures implemented:

Environment variables loaded via dotenv

API keys stored in .env

Rate limiting middleware implemented

Missing dependency (express-rate-limit) identified and installed

Backend crash resolved and server runs successfully

System Integrity:

Frontend ↔ Backend connectivity verified

No API keys exposed to browser

No mock or static JSON used for core features

Architecture is hackathon-safe and demo-ready

End of completed status. Do not infer future work.
